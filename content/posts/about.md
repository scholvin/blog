## about the blogger

<img src="/img/headshot.jpg" width="50%" alt="head shot">

Your friendly proprietor splits his time between the suburbs of both
Chicago and Boston, never far from the Lagrange points described by the gravity wells of 
family, work, and recreation. Interests include, but are not limited to, parenting, music,
science and technology, politics, current events, sports, and travel. The mood tends toward pessimism,
but perhaps not unrelentingly so.

## dramatis personae

You'll see references to the family here by their names, not some coy abbreviations or 
their ages. Meet Danny, Leah, and Sharon:

In late 2024, we had to say goodbye to Arlee. She was a very good girl.

(it's very hard to get a good pic of a black dog who never stops moving)

## about the blog

Everything old is new again.

I decided to go back to blogging in a more traditional format, and, 
in parallel, to step back from mindless consumption of the usual social media platforms. Write more,
scroll less. Hopefully. This blog is the primary implementation of that decision. Deleting most of the
apps with a blue icon from my phone is the rest.

At the moment, I have no plans to enable commenting or liking/rating systems. I have come to believe
those mechanisms trigger and reward the worst behaviors we see online. If you'd like to share any
thoughts about what you see here, there are plenty of contact icons up there to choose from.

If you'd like to receive new posts via email, that's possible [here](https://scholvin.com/email/subscribe).

Trigger warning: commas will be brutally misused, except Oxford commas, which are sacrosanct
and will always be in place.

Housekeeping: some posts here are from old blogs; those are tagged ["imported"]("/tags/imported"). Any posts
edited after initial publication (beyond trivial grammar/spelling issues) will be tagged ["edited"]("/tags/edited").

It should go without saying, but I'll say it anyway: nothing here should ever be construed as
me speaking on behalf of my employer.

Nuts and bolts: I'm trying to do this fast, light, and cheap. It's a static site powered by 
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io) featuring the [Vitae](https://github.com/dataCobra/hugo-vitae) theme.
The web server is [lighttpd](https://www.lighttpd.net/) and I use [GoAccess](https://goaccess.io/) to
look at the log files once in a while.  It's homed in lovely Oregon, USA, under the benevolent gaze
of the world's richest man. I'm not using any trackers or cookies or beacons or any other
creepy shit that might follow you around the internet. Let's just keep this between us.
