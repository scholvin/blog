Observations from the field:

* _Mechanical Advantage_: This unit has five forward gears of increasing speed and commensurately decreasing torque, and this gearing appears to apply to both the traction
drive and the snow ejector combine. The label implies that the slower speeds are for heavy, wet snow, and so I used them today. Today's snow
is of about average wetness, but there was ten inches of it and I thought low speed / high torque was the right way to go. **FALSE**. About halfway
through, I found that it was actually working much better at higher speed. Maybe the GoPro would have survived the whole run if
I'd known that going in.
* _Universal Gas Law_: Pneumatic tires seemed like a good idea when I bought it. Tuning the machine up in November, including 
checking and filling the tires,
was a good idea, too. Failing to account for the pressure drop in those tires
on a day that's about 30ยบ colder than when I filled them was a _bad_ idea. (Or maybe it was just a leak.) One of the tires had depressurized
to the point that it was spinning freely on the wheel. You don't need a physics background to know that's not good for traction.
* _Wave Function Collapse_: Upon discovering I had a flat tire, I discovered that my compressor was leaking and I could not fill the tire.
Was it broken before then? Or did it break when I observed it? Who can say? What difference is there?
* _Law of the Lever_: this blower is back-heavy, with the center of mass of the motor being over the wheels. Maybe they're all that way,
so the weight pushes down on the wheels to provide better traction. The counter effect, though, is that the thing wants to pop a wheelie
(that's the scientific term) and the front snow intake wants to ride up over the snow. Lots of dragging it back and doing that part
again. Heavy. Tiring.
* _Conservation of Matter_: we get nasty emails from the village about not blowing snow into the street, but when their plows deposit
a couple of tons of it on my driveway's end, three or four times per storm, I feel no qualms about putting it right back where it came from.
