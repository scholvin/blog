Improvisation. It’s chilly down in the work room, only about 64°—not quite where I want my seedlings to be. So I went out to the garage and dug out some ancient Christmas lights, the old school C9 style. These used to adorn the front yard of my grandparents’ house in Marquette Park c. 1987, and now they provide about 7W each of heat to the enclosure. We’re up to 72° now, and a lot more festive to boot.
