The lemon tree project waits for no one. That guy on the left is finna be culled this week, leaving me with two candidates. Eight sprouts, six plantings, five seedlings, three survivors, soon two. I may pot them both.</p><p>Gonna be tough to get these ladies to adulthood when I start my time on the road. Hopefully someone here can tend to them.
