On Friday, in what will stand out as an absolute highlight of this summer, we went up to 
Summerfest to see Fountains of Wayne.

With some bands, you can remember the exact moment you fell in love with them. I was in my car 
one morning in the summer of 2003, listening to WXRT, hearing this mournful, 
minor keyed ballad with an understated baritone vocal. A haunting, clear toned guitar 
line with a gentle tremolo set the verses apart from each other. It really stood out from 
whatever else I was hearing at the time. One 
[lyric](https://genius.com/Fountains-of-wayne-hackensack-lyrics) just about caused me to 
pull over: "I saw you talkin' / to Christopher Walken / on my TV screen." It takes a rare 
kind of genius to put a reference like that into your song and not play it for a cheap 
laugh.

As usual, XRT was in front of it. "Stacy's Mom" would go supernova a few weeks later in 
part thanks to the [video](https://youtu.be/zSGjevDzBpk?si=F10YuVlzg1OlFeLa), but by then I'd had the CD in constant rotation. _Welcome 
Interstate Managers_ is their third album, and the only one that achieved any kind of 
commercial success. In my opinion, it's the best album of the aughts. The first four 
songs, "[Mexican Wine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4blhM9IU3A)", "Bright Future in 
Sales", "Stacy's Mom", and "Hackensack" (the one above that Lin Brehmer introduced to me) 
is as strong an album start as I can think of.

Also as usual, I was late to the party with this band. Back in '96 when my band was on 
the road a lot, their debut album was in the rotation in the van. Tony and Devin were 
particularly fond of it, but for whatever reason it didn't really speak to me, and I kind 
of dismissed the band as doing a novelty bit or something. It's that same fine line about 
navigating some of the humorous and pop cultural references in the lyrics. That first 
album, at least then, didn't land for me. But as is so often the case, once you 
discover you love a band, you can go back and hear their earlier work with new ears, and 
find what you missed the first time. My bandmates were right, which I'm sure they'll be 
delighted to read.

A memory I tie very specifically to _Welcome Interstate Managers_ is listening to it over 
and over as I prepared the spare room in our old house for Danny's arrival the 
following spring. The tiny bedroom at the top of the stairs had devolved into junk 
storage, as any unused room in any house I inhabit will tend to do. The de-junking, 
painting, electrical work, window treatments, furniture assembly---that album was the 
soundtrack to all of it. I don't know how much music is absorbed in utero, but if any is, 
it's surely the music Danny heard first. My obsession with the record continued into the 
early years of his life, so he surely heard it in the car as I drove around that first 
year, trying desperately to get him to fall asleep in back.

They released two more albums of original material after that, both of which took me a 
little more time to appreciate. Turns out the making of them was fraught for all sorts of 
interpersonal reasons in the band, and you can hear it in the outcome. Not _bad_, surely, 
but maybe not _easy_. I love those later records, too, though it's different. Throughout all that 
time, I had opportunities to see them live. But with little kids in the house, well, you know 
how that goes. There's never time. FOW unoffically disbanded and went 
their separate ways in about 2013, and it seemed my chance was gone.

Adam Schlesinger, the co-founder, bassist, and one of the two principal songwriters[^1]
 (along with lead vocalist Chris Collingwood) 
[died](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/01/arts/music/adam-schlesinger-dead-coronavirus.html) 
from complications of Covid in April of 2020. Of all the incalculable losses during that 
hideous time, his passing hit me particularly hard. Remember that era specifically: 
thousands were dying in hospital hallways, the economy had shut down, there was no 
vaccine on the horizon, no effective treatments, and very little hope. We were 
celebrating children's birthdays by driving past their homes and waving. To suffer the 
loss of this brilliant artist was almost more than I could take. It took a long time for 
me to get past it, and I spent plenty of time kicking my own ass for not working harder 
to go see Fountains of Wayne live when I had chances to do so.

We move ahead to this year. They announced a limited festival tour with Max 
Collins of Eve6 filling in on bass and background vocals, and Summerfest was on the list. 
I've had the Fourth of July circled on my calendar for months. That holiday used to mean 
a lot to me; not so much now. Finally, a thing to celebrate. So Sharon and I made the 
trip up there Friday, where we caught up with Tony and Dave, my own bandmates who'd been 
right about this band the whole time. Through some business connections, Dave scored us 
free admission and wristbands to get us up into a "VIP" area in front of the stage.

Can't lie. I had some trepidation about it. This was a show I've been waiting to see for 
over twenty years, and a critical element was missing. Would it work? Could it possibly 
live up to my imagination and anticipation? I am thrilled to report that yes, it 
absolutely did. If I have any gripe, and this is the pinnacle of a First World Problem, 
it's that we were so close to the stage that we really couldn't hear Jody Porter's guitar 
solos as clearly as I'd have wanted. He keeps his stage volume low and counts on 
the house PA to cover him.[^2] But that was of minor concern. The band killed it, Chris 
sounded great, and Max, filling really big shoes, delivered a rock solid yet low profile 
performance. The [set list](https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/fountains-of-wayne/2025/briggs-and-stratton-big-backyard-milwaukee-wi-335a6c8d.html) 
was pretty close to exactly what I'd have drawn up for myself. Earlier in the tour, they 
were only playing songs from the first three albums, but they're starting to venture into 
the other two.

It was cathartic. This year, while nothing like the agony of 2020, has been full of 
difficulty and heartbreak, too. I needed a win, and I got one.

[^1]: Adam is also the victim of the greatest Oscar injustice of all time. He wrote the supernaturally
catchy title song to "That Thing You Do!" and was nominated for Best Original Song in 1996. It's
a bona fide masterpiece of pop perfection, yet it inexplicably lost
to some piece of shit that Andrew Lloyd Webber threw together as a single for Madonna in the movie version of _Evita_.
I will never, ever get over it.
