**UPDATE:** The beta test is now over. Thanks to everyone who helped! I'll be putting this into production shortly.

OK, I think I finally have enough bugs beaten out of my email subscription management system to make it ready for a public beta test.

I'm looking for the following from volunteer testers:

* the ability to follow directions
* a willingness to try to break the thing
* the ability to report errors accurately, including knowing how to take a screenshot and to attach that to an email
* access to a diverse set of devices, operating systems, mail apps, browsers, etc.

If you meet those criteria and are willing to help, this won't take a lot of time, and you'll have my undying gratitude. You'll interact with the website and some emails. You can quit whenever you want, and I'll probably end the beta after a few days, maybe a week. I'm looking for 5-10 volunteers for this, though of course I'll take what I can get.

Still want to help? Here's the first instruction you need to follow to the letter: please send an email to john@scholvin.com. Further instructions will be sent to you later. Please note that replying with an offer to volunteer on Facebook where you see this post linked is appreciated, but not a valid request.
